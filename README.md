This project uses the requests library as well as Python's Beautiful Soup to scrape data from various websites in order to create a visualization of medals won per capita, and gold medals won per capita, for the top performing countries in those categories. Motivation for this project came during the Tokyo 2020 olympics during which athletes from my home country as well as several other small nations distinguished themselves in various athletic disciplines.
